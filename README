COUNTER > one goal of this project is to add a simple counter that gathers and displays statistics for good and bad browsers. the counter should work with the javascript widget, so when the widget loads on a page, the sinatra script gets pinged to update the counter. if you have any tips to make this work, make contact.

=== installation ===

git clone git://github.com/seaofclouds/good-browser-bad-browser.git 

sinatra is now included in the vendor directory, so to keep it up to date, you can do:

git submodule init && git submodule update
