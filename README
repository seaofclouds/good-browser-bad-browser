good browser, bad browser is a very simple browser detection script that powers the amazing good browser advocacy site: http://goodbrowserbadbrowser.com

if you haven't already, download yourself a good browser from http://www.apple.com/safari/ or http://www.firefox.com, then tell your friends.

our plan is to one day provide unobtrusive browser detection badges that you can display on your site to encourage upgrades to good browsers.
